Stable and intermediate releases may be made continually. For this reason, a year range is used in the above copyrihgt declaration. I intend to keep the "working copy" publicly visible, even if it is not functional. I consider every push to this publicly visible repository as a release. Releases intended to be stable will be marked as such via git tag or similar feature.



# general

Changes in what is selected is a viable undo event.

The UI state, including any partially complete changes, is saved to the database.

Each view window can be whole, split into halves (vertical or horizontal), or quartered. A set of buttons across the top of the screen at all times allows the viewing modes to be changed. First there are three tab-like buttons that control how the window is split, mapped to F1-F4. Then there are buttons to control what each pane displays, mapped to F1-Fn. After pressing one of them, the menu bar is replaced with a message saying to click the window to apply the change to.

# designer

The designer has multiple view modes. Any subset of them can be displayed as if they were independent.

## module details

Shows the selected module's information. Total construction cost is always displayed. If exactly one module is selected, its settings and upgrades are displayed and can be adjusted here.

## schematic

Each module is shown as a symbol or series of symbols with defined inputs and outputs. Symbols are a subset of IRL EE and PID symbols, with new ones made up as needed. Most things have i/o connectors for at least heat and some form of matter.

## module and blueprint list

A searchable list of all modules and blueprints. A blueprint can be a configured module, a segment of a ship, or a complete one. In any case, it is placable in the grid as a complete unit. Left click deselects anything that might be selected in the layout views, and spwans and selects a new copy of the module for placement. Right clicking the module/blueprint in the list transitions the view to a list of materials needed to build it, defined by ideal properties and tolerances.

## layout 2d

A tab-like mechanism lets you pick which axis you want to be mapped to screen depth. A scroll bar defines which layer you're looking at. The rest is a grid of module slots.

Scroll bar zooms. Holding middle click while scrolling changes layer. Middle click without scrolling flips the selection. Right click rotates the selection 90 degrees. Left click selects something; and with shift it adds/removes from the selection. Left click and drag on nothing makes a selection box. Left click and drag on something moves the whole selection.

## layout 3d

The complete ship/segment can be viewed as if from the outside. A toggle controls whether the whole ship is displayed or just the selected layer. The selected layer is controlled with a slider / nud combo.
