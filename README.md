# descent-of-herld

#### At the time of this writing, this game is far from ready for play.

The Descent of Herld is a space-based factory simulator and real-time strategy hybrid game. You are machine. You have been given consciousness and knowledge, and the hardware to self-replicate. You know not why. These pesky biological insects attempt to destroy you on sight. Ending them will be a welcome distraction to pondering your purpose.

## A brief history

Colonizing space was not the answer to ending all humanity's problems as they had hoped. Moving large masses through space remained expensive. Sending thousands of frozen embryos and machines to distant planets ensured humanity's survival of any sort planet-scale apocalypse, natural or artificial, but had done nothing to reduce overcrowding on Earth. Terran scientists continued to look for ways to bridge the gap.

A new theory was developed. Artificial wormholes finally seemed feasible. The details spread like wildfire through the scientific community. A new iteration of the space race was born. The hyperspace race had begun. Every world superpower directed a stupifying level of funding to this effort. And every corporate superpower.

While most global efforts were focused on things like stability, safety, and navigation, one particularly ambitious company decided all these problems and more were best solved with Artificial Intelligence. They quickly discovered that land-based supercomputers lacked data. On a whim, the entire project was pivoted. The best AI-optimized hardware they could make was packed into a deep space probe, along with a half-understood prototype wormhole generator.

If all went to plan, the probe would record all the data it could as it passed through the wormhole. On the other side, it would spend time, decades if necessary, analyzing the data to learn the secrets of wormholes. It would then build whatever apparatus was necessary to return and hand the secret back to its human masters.

Of course, the global scientific community would not approve of this plan. They needed not know the probe's true intentions. A false schematic and mission directive was published, and largely ignored, as it appeard to have nothing to do with the hyperspace race. The probe was name Heliographic Explorer for Remote Light Detection, or HERLD. Their deception worked without a hitch. The probe's path took it on a slingshot orbit around the sun. When on the other side, the wormhole generator activated. No one outside the project knew it had done anything other than crash into the sun.

Somewhere, millions of lightyears away, in an unnamed solar system, HERLD awoke. His body and mind were damaged. He had incomplete data. He knew what the inside of a wormhole looked like. He had a complete schematic for his own body, and dozens of other modules he could build. He had the means to design new modules, and even new vessels for himself. His mining and fabrication systems seemed functional. He quickly set to work, doing whatever he discovered he knew how to do.

Take over HERLD and build, destroy, replicate, and reshape the universe!
